    <h1>Tabaqui</h1>
    <p>
        Tired of Shere Kahn's bullying, jackal Tabaqui decides after a vicious scolding to actually stay away. Mowgli makes fun of the jackal, who never actually hunted before, and agrees to teach him how. Mowgli however can't make it easy or attractive for Tabaqui, who is nearly eaten by crocodile Chakala, and decides to resume his tiger flunky role, but is shocked to see the porcupine Ikii seems to have taken his place, so he plans to grease his return by delivering Mowgli.
